    <h1> K-means Clustering Done Right: Parallel K-means with OpenMP</h1>
    <h2> Project done by Tianqi (Andy) Wu and Alex Zhang</h2>

    <p>Project Goal: Building an efficient parallelized K-means clustering with OpenMP</p>


    <h3>BACKGROUND (with help from 10-601 lectures):</h3>

    <p>The goal of clustering algorithms in machine learning is to partition unlabeled data into groups with similar features. 
    It can be very useful when analyzing data and classify them. The goal of K-means clustering, in this scenario, is to find 
    an assignment of points to each cluster. </p>

    <p>The algorithm can be expressed verbally as follows: </p>
    We have a series of unlabeled feature vectors. 
    We first initial a

    <h3>THE CHALLENGE</h3>
    
    1. The curse of dimensionality. Given the mass amount of data and the possible size of the schema (if any), 
    the data can be relatively difficult to handle, and this can lead to even exponentially growing search time.

    2. Initialization issues. K-means, when not being initialized correctly, can lead to problems. For example, an outlier can 
    drive the result unreasonable from the first glance.

    3. Termination. In the realm of K-means, when and how to terminate the task can be an issue.

    Resources:

    ????????? Should we use an existing C++ implementation and try to tweak it, or should we write our own?

    ????????? What data should we use? Kaggle/other data ????????? 

    ????????? Reference: 10601 slides ???????

    <h3>Goals</h3>

    1. Implement a parallel K-means algorithm with OpenMP to reduce clustering time. We are thinking about parallelization based on 
    each cluster center / each data point. Which one would work better?

    2. Find a strategy to detect early initialization errors (if any) / try various initialization strategies

    3. Present the visualization process using tools so that it can be easily identifiable

    4. Find a way to preprocess (if any) to significantly reduce find-nearest time

    <h3>Platform:</h3>

    OpenMP + GHC/PSC. We are very proficient with OpenMP. Probably add an evaluation also.
